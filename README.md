# WordGuessGame aka: Bovine Abduction

You must save your bovine brethern from abduction! This is a classic hangman-style word-guessing game. Be careful though, don't let the aliens take all your cows.

# HOW TO PLAY:

Click the "Save Da Mooers" button to initialize the game. You use your keyboard to make up to nine guesses in order to correctly identify the word completely. 

For each incorrect guess, the evil alien ship will abduct one of your cows. If you run out of cows, you lose. You will not get any points for a lost game, but you won't lose points either. You may click the "Save Da Mooers" button to play again.

For each correct guess, the spaces given will fill with the letter. Fill in all the letters to win. You will get points corresponding to how many cows you managed to save. You may click the "Save Da Mooers" button to play again.

# Primary Challenges Faced: 

The main issue I had to overcome with this one was my own desire to continue tinkering with it. I learned so much about CSS from this project simply by knowing what I wanted to do and researching how to get that done.
